    <p>Donors and members subscribe to The Texas Tribuneâ€™s belief that promoting greater civic engagement and informed discourse is a direct route to a better and more productive Texas. They play no role in guiding the journalism produced by the Tribune or the planning and execution of events. </p>
    <p>If you are interested in becoming a donor or a member, click <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/join/">here</a>. </p>
    <p>When it comes to our <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/support-us/donors-and-members/">donors</a> and <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/support-us/corporate-sponsors/">corporate sponsors</a>, the Tribune is committed to full transparency.</p>
    <p>
    When donors or <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/support-us/corporate-sponsors/">corporate sponsors</a> who
    have given $1,000 or more to the Tribune are named in our stories, we disclose
    them on those pages. Donors who have given $5,000 or more are classified as
    "major donors."
